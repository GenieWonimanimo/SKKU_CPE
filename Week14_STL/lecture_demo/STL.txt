****Standard Containers in STL****
Simple containers
    pair
    tuple

Sequence containers: ordered collections
    vector: dynamic array
    list: doubly linked list
    deque: double-ended queue (adapted to stack and queue)

Associated containers: unordered collections
    set, multiset
    map: dictionary(internally ordered by balanced binary tree)
    multimap: similar to map, but with duplicate keys
    unordered_map: dictionary with hash


*****Standard Adaptors in STL****
Adaptors: template classes have default containers underneath ex) stack, queue -> deque       priority_queue -> vector
        wrapping a common container to implement data structures
        Implemented "on top of" other classes

Examples from deque
    stack
    queue

Examples from vector
    priority_queue

priority_queue
    priority_queue<T, container<T>, order)
    vector is default container
    default order is ascending order (std::less<T>)
    example declaration
        priority_queue<int> p_queue;
        priority_queue<int, deque<int>, std::greater<int>> p_queue;
